This is CSCI.713.01 - Applied Perception in Graphics assignment 1.

Which is based on the paper Hybrid images(by A. Oliva, A. Torralba, P.G. Schyns).

You can use it to produce an hybrid images.

Before run the programming, make sure the two images you selected have the same size.

If you selected two different size images, use the photoshop to cut off them in the same size or use the matlab function imrezise to make sure the two images have the same size.

For my case, I had deal with the two images and make sure they are in the same size.

Then, you just need to open MATLAB, make sure the two images and hybridImage.m in the same doc, and run the program, you can get the hybrid image of these two images.

If it is not looks as ideal as your expect, you can adjust the parameters to obtain more ideal result.For my case, I had adjust it.
